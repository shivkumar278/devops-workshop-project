## Jenkins Installation process in ubuntu machine

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins


### Another process to install jenkins 

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
sudo apt install maven -y
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
  
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y


### This is what you get when trying to contact the Jenkins web server from the localhost

root@base:~# curl -vI http://localhost:8080/jenkins/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> HEAD /jenkins/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
>



### Jenkins Configuration: The configuration file at /etc/default/jenkins

### Log Files: The Jenkins log file at /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log

### Firewall Rules (iptables -S): All the chains/rules (INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT) are set to ACCEPT. Still, since communication here is within the localhost

### Network Packets and Ports (netstat -tapon): Shows Jenkins (java process) listening on the expected port (default 8080, but I've tried others); it also shows the connection as ESTABLISHED (on both ends) after the curl client sends a request like the one shown above. This shows a successful TCP handshake.

### Network Traffic (tcpdump -i lo): Shows the 3-way handshake being made; it explains why netstat shows connections as ESTABLISHED



### To check the jenkins services status

    systemsctl status jenkins

### To start the jenkins services
